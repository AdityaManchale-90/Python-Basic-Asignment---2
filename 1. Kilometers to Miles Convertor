# 1. Write a Python program to convert kilometers to miles?

# In this program we take input from user and convert to miles from kilometers by using conversion factor = 0.621371

km = input("Enter the values in kilometers: ")
conv_fact = 0.621371
mi = float(km) * conv_fact
print("For {0} km the value of mile is {1} mi." .format(km,mi))
