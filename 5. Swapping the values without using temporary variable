# 5. Write a Python program to swap two variables without temp variable?

# In this program we take inputs from user and swap the variables.

a = input("Enter the first value: ")
b = input("Enter the second value: ")
print("Before swapping the values of a is {0} & b is {1} ".format(a,b))
a,b = b,a
print("After swapping the values of a is {0} & b is {1} ".format(a,b))
